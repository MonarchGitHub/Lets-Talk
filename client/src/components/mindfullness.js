<h2>The Experience of Anger</h2>Anger is a fundamental emotion that <em>everyone</em> experiences from time to time.<p></p>
<p>From a very early age, people learn to express anger by copying the angry behavior they see <strong>modeled</strong> around them, and by expressing angry behavior and seeing what they can get away with.</p></div>

<p>As our culture has an uneasy relationship with anger expression, many people are brought up to <em>think that it is inappropriate to express anger</em> directly; that it must not be tolerated; that it is always dangerous. Such people learn to distrust anger, to bottle it up and ignore it, to express it only in indirect ways or to use it as a weapon.</p>
